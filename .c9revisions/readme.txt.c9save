{"ts":1378325020706,"silentsave":true,"restoring":false,"patch":[[{"diffs":[[1,"=== Download Monitor ===\nContributors: mikejolley\nDonate link: https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&business=mike.jolley@me.com&item_name=Donation+for+Download+Monitor\nTags: download, downloads, monitor, hits, download monitor, tracking, admin, count, counter, files, versions, download count, logging\nRequires at least: 3.5\nTested up to: 3.6\nStable tag: 1.1.1\nLicense: GPLv3\n\nDownload Monitor is a plugin for uploading and managing downloads, tracking downloads, and displaying links.\n\n== Description ==\n\nDownload Monitor provides an interface for uploading and managing downloadable files (including support for multiple versions), inserting download links into posts, and logging downloads.\n\n= Features =\n\n* Add, edit and remove downloads from a familiar WP interface; just like posts.\n* Quick-add panel for adding files whilst editing posts.\n* Add multiple file versions to your downloads.\n* Define alternative links (mirrors) per version.\n* Categorise, tag, or add other meta to your downloads.\n* Display download links on the frontend using shortcodes.\n* Change the way download links get displayed via template files.\n* Track downloads counts and log user download attempts.\n* Member only downloads.\n* Customisable endpoints for showing pretty download links.\n\n[Read more about Download Monitor](http://mikejolley.com/projects/download-monitor/).\n\n= Documentation =\n\nDocumentation will be maintained on the [GitHub Wiki here](https://github.com/mikejolley/download-monitor/wiki).\n\n= Add-ons =\n\nAdd-ons, such as the __legacy importer__ and __page addon__ can be [found here](http://mikejolley.com/projects/download-monitor/add-ons/). Take a look!\n\n= Contributing and reporting bugs =\n\nYou can contribute code and localizations to this plugin via GitHub: [https://github.com/mikejolley/download-monitor](https://github.com/mikejolley/download-monitor)\n\n= Support =\n\nUse the WordPress.org forums for community support - I cannot offer support directly for free. If you spot a bug, you can of course log it on [Github](https://github.com/mikejolley/download-monitor) instead where I can act upon it more efficiently.\n\nIf you want help with a customisation, hire a developer!\n\n== Installation ==\n\n= Automatic installation =\n\nAutomatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't even need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.\n\nIn the search field type \"Download Monitor\" and click Search Plugins. Once you've found the plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by clicking _Install Now_.\n\n= Manual installation =\n\nThe manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application.\n\n* Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it\n* Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installation's `wp-content/plugins/` directory.\n* Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu within the WordPress admin.\n\n== Frequently Asked Questions ==\n\n= I used this before, so why is this version 1? =\n\nVersion 1.0.0 is a fresh start/complete rewrite of the legacy 3.0 version using modern best-practices such as custom post types and endpoints. Because of this, data from the legacy plugin won't work without migration using [the legacy importer](http://mikejolley.com/projects/download-monitor/add-ons/legacy-importer/). Since this upgrade process isn't straightforward nor automated I've reverted the version to 1.0.0 to prevent automatic updates.\n\nLegacy versions can still be [found here](http://wordpress.org/plugins/download-monitor/developers/).\n\n= X feature/shortcode is missing from the legacy version; why? =\n\nThe rewrite has trimmed the fat and only kept the best, most useful features. If something is missing, you can always code it yourself - the new system is very flexible and its easy to query files using [get_posts](http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/get_posts).\n\nIf you are missing the \"Page Addon\", this is now a separate plugin found here: [Download Monitor Page Addon](http://mikejolley.com/projects/download-monitor/add-ons/page-addon/).\n\n= Can I upload .xxx filetype using the uploader? =\n\nDownload Monitor uses the WordPress uploader for uploading files. By default these formats are supported:\n\n* Images - .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif\n* Documents - .pdf, .doc, .docx, .ppt, .pptx, .pps, .ppsx, .odt, .xls, .xlsx\n* Music - .mp3, .m4a, .ogg, .wav\n* Video - .mp4, .m4v, .mov, .wmv, .avi, .mpg, .ogv, .3gp, .3g2\n\nTo add more you can use a plugin, or filters. This post is a good resource for doing it with filters: [Change WordPress Upload Mime Types](http://www.paulund.co.uk/change-wordpress-upload-mime-types).\n\n= Can I link to external downloads? =\n\nYes, you can use both local paths and external URLs.\n\n= My Download links 404 =\n\nDownload links are powered by endpoints. If you find them 404'ing, go to Settings > Permalinks and save. This will flush the permalinks and allow our endpoints to be added.\n\n= Download counts are not increasing when I download something =\n\nAdmin hits are not counted, log out and try!\n\n== Screenshots ==\n\n1. The main admin screen lists your downloads using familiar WordPress UI.\n2. Easily add file information and multiple versions.\n3. The quick add panel can be opened via a link about the post editor. This lets you quickly add a file and insert it into a post.\n4. Display regular download links or fancy ones all using shortcodes and templates.\n\n== Changelog ==\n\n= 1.1.1 =\n* Specify error statuses on wp_die messages e.g. 404 for missing files.\n* Moved DONOTCACHEPAGE\n\n= 1.1.0 =\n* Fixed admin notices\n* Added download link to admin 'file' column for copying and pasting\n* Farsi localisation\n* Wrapping content in a [download] shortcode will wrap it in a simple link.\n\n= 1.0.6 =\n* Hide taxonomies from nav menus\n* Fix categories in download_data method.\n\n= 1.0.5 =\n* When do_not_force is enabled, still replace abspath with home_url\n* Exclude dlm_download from search and disable query var\n* Added category_include_children option for downloads shortcode\n* Fixed logs time offset.\n\n= 1.0.4 =\n* Tweak admin page detection to work when no downloads exist.\n* Fix dashboard widget warning.\n* Add filters to logs and export csv function.\n* Added extra columns to CSV.\n\n= 1.0.3 =\n* Fix config page to work with multibyte tab names.\n* Japanese locale by hide92795\n* Admin CSS/script conditonally loaded\n* Versions are now strtolower to be compatible with version_compare and to standardise numbers.\n\n= 1.0.2 =\n* Only use wp_remote_head to get fielsize on remote files.
